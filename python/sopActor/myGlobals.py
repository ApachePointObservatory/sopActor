This is a blank file that is used to contain things that will get passed around
inside the sopActor.

If you go looking for a 'myGlobals = blah' definition, you aren't
going to find it, because the existence of this file *is* that. What
you will see, is something like the following:
    
import sopActor.myGlobals as myGlobals
myGlobals.blah = foo
