Each file in this directory should be the name of a unittest TestCase
class. Command list entries look like this:

[test_function_name]
thing1
thing2 arg1
# I'm a comment!

thing3 arg1 arg2

thing4 arg1
thing5 arg1 arg2

This means that things 1,2 (could happen in any order), then thing3,
then things 4,5 (in any order). We have to do this because we don't
know what order the threads will receive and execute their commands,
so, e.g. a set of lamp off commands could come out in any order.


NOTE: to be very strict about this, the "if test_calls is not None"
bit in sopTester.check_cmd could be removed, which would mean we'd
have to have a cmd call list for each function. Being strict about
this is a good thing....
